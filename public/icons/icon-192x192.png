This is a placeholder file. To generate proper PNG icons:

1. Use the generate-icons.html file in the root directory
2. Open it in a browser
3. Right-click on each icon and save as PNG
4. Replace this file with the generated PNG

Or use an online tool like:

- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

For now, the SVG icons will work in most browsers, but PNG is required for full PWA compliance.
